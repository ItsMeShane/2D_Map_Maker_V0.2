# Map_Maker_V0.2
A 2D map editor designed for creating a number map which my game (next project)
will convert into a visual map. Contains over 1900 unique 32x32 tiles.

With version 0.2 you can now do the folowing:

-Undo Moves

-Change Map Dimensions

-Draw and a fill a rectangle

-Save Your Map

-Load Your Map

Along with these changes there has been a lot of code-cleanup and
performance improvments. Certain calculations are being calculated 
much more effienctly (roughly 4x faster).
